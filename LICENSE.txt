LICENSE TERMS OF THE ENTIRETY OF 6502V.

!!SPECIAL NOTICE!!
THE basic license of 6502V and its source code is the 4-clause ("classic" or
"original") BSD license. This means that, apart from the usual BSD license 
clauses, you must also acknowledge in any material advertising features of
a derivative product that said derivative contains source developed by me
and my contributors.

THIS, however, is for negotiation if I find that you, upon contacting me and
describing and/or showing your derivative product to me, have deserved a more
lenient license. In that case, I will exclusively license 6502V to you under
the terms of a non-advertising open source license of our common choice --
usually the 2/3-clause BSD or MIT license.


I SHAN'T license this or any other piece of my "intellectual
property" under the GPL (and GPL-like) family of licenses. I find that the GPL
restricts both my - and your (as a user and possible derivative product developer) -
freedom to an intolerable degree, and that the licenses are grounded in
failed ideological thinking, enforcing rigid rules just like the proprietary
software, the authors of the license are so exceedingly bellicose against.

If you desire to seek exclusive licensing of this product, contact me:
