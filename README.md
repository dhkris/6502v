A lightning fast MOS6502 virtual machine!

Written in ANSI C, 6502V emulates a MOS 6502 based system with:
 * 64 kilobytes of RAM and ROM
 * Up to 256 interrupt syscalls
 * Customizable clock rate for synchronization purposes
 * A full 6502 instruction set

6502V currently compiles correctly with any reasonably standards-compliant C-compiler, including GCC, Clang, ICC and PCC.
